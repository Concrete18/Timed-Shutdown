# Timed Shutdown/Sleep
Set a shutdown or sleep to a specifc amount of minutes away.

## Features
* Allows whole mumbers and decimals for minute entry.
* Detects current sleep standby time.
* If current PC sleep standby is shorter then the set timer, then it will make it long enough and change it back before iniating the action. (Closing the script before it finishes will leave the standby time on the new setting.)

## Future Plans
* new Tkinter interface.
* Way to cancel if stanby time was changed.
